## Discuss how i managed the state in your assignment project.

Regarding how I managed state in my assignment project, I used Reactâ€™s built-in useState hook to manage local state within each component. I also used useEffect hook to handle side effects such as fetching data from an API. For global state management.**Details are described below:-**

- **To manage the api data**: I use a useState hook that stores the data in a state variable. I also use a useEffect hook that runs after the component renders and fetches the data from the api. Inside the useEffect hook, I use the setState function to update the state variable with the fetched data. Based on this data, I dynamically create cards that display the course information.

- **To manage the selected course data**: I use another useState hook that stores an array of selected courses in a state variable. I also use a setState function to update the state variable when the user selects or deselects a course. Based on this state variable, I display a cart that shows the selected courses and their information.

- **To manage the total credit hours**: I use another useState hook that stores the total credit hours in a state variable. I also use a setState function to update the state variable when the user selects or deselects a course. I use a reduce function to calculate the total credit hours from the selected courses array. Based on this state variable, I display the total credit hours in the cart.

- **To manage the remaining credit hours**: I use another useState hook that stores the remaining credit hours in a state variable. I also use a setState function to update the state variable when the user selects or deselects a course. I use a subtraction operation to calculate the remaining credit hours from the total credit hours and the maximum credit hours allowed. Based on this state variable, I display the remaining credit hours in the cart.
